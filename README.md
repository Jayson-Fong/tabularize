# Purpose

Tabularize aids in the parsing of semi-structured data in a table-like format into Python dictionaries given no
knowledge of the expected data format.

While packages such as [csv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html), [pandas](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/),
and [TextFSM](https://pypi.org/project/textfsm/) exist, they require the input data to be in a more structured form. For 
example, requiring clearly distinguishable delimiters, fixed column widths, or knowledge about the data to deduce the 
start and end of a column based on data types. Tabularize is designed for instances where there can be guess-work due to 
input data not following these constraints.

This package's design takes influence from the [Name/Finger protocol](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc742) due
to its non-standardized, human-readable status reports that tend to give machines a harder time.

<summary>📇 Name/Finger Protocol</summary>

Tabularize is particularly useful for parsing the Name/Finger Protocol given that the `fingerd` server implementation is 
unknown due to its lack of standardization. However, if the server implementation is known, consider using a 
regular expression-based solution instead such as [TextFSM](https://pypi.org/project/textfsm/) as the data types can
help indicate the start and end of output.
